# Guessing Game
This is a simple guessing game built with JavaScript interacting with the DOM API. In it, the user must guess a number between 1 and 100. The program will respond if the number is higher and lower. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program will inform the user how many guesses it took and allow the game to be re-started. The number is randomly generated.
